==> This Folder is all about pre-processing the data

	--> stream_data.py : It generates three csv files corresponding to email_body(email_data.csv),
	   
	    email_nodes(email_user_data.csv) and email_subject(email_subject.csv).

	--> pre_processing.py : It pre-processes the email_body.

	--> merge_data.py : It merges the two files (email_data.csv and email_user_data.csv) 		
	    generated by stream_data.py.

	--> remove_duplicates.py : It removes the duplicates from the csv generated by merge_data.py.

	--> seperate_data.py : It seperates back the merged csv files.

	--> sort_timestamps.py : It sorts the csv file based on the timestamps.
